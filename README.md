# awx_rhel-lifecycle
   Management of RHEL servers' lifecycle with AWX Project or Ansible
   Tower

## Playbooks and comments:

* init.yml
  - Usage: install the Foreman collection from Ansible Galaxy      
  - No variable needs to be declared for this playbook 
  - **Note**: AWX 9.1.0.0 uses Ansible 2.8.5 meaning that we cannot install collections with the ansible-galaxy command. It will be necessary to remove the mazer dependancy and replace mazer by ansible-galaxy when Ansible will be updated to 2.9

* cdn_unregister.yml
  - Usage: unregister a RHEL server from Red Hat CDN     
  - Variables to declare in AWX (Tower):
    - `decom_host`: host to unregister from RH CDN      

* fman_rm-host.yml - **WIP**
  - Usage: delete a host from Foreman (Satellite)
